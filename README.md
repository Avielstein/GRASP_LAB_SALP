# GRASP Lab SALP Robot Simulation

Bio-inspired soft underwater robot simulation based on research from the University of Pennsylvania Sung Robotics Lab. This project implements SALP (Salp-inspired Approach to Low-energy Propulsion) robots in a Gymnasium environment for reinforcement learning research.

## Overview

This repository contains implementations of bio-inspired underwater robots that mimic the locomotion of marine salps - barrel-shaped invertebrates that swim via jet propulsion through rhythmic body contractions and expansions.

## üé¨ Demo Video

Watch our AI-trained SALP robot in action! After 1000 episodes of reinforcement learning, the robot successfully navigates and collects food using bio-inspired jet propulsion.

## Features

### SALP Robot (`salp_robot.py`)
- **Slow, realistic breathing cycles** (2-3 seconds per phase)
- **Hold-to-inhale control scheme** for natural underwater movement
- **Steerable rear nozzle** (not body rotation) for directional control
- **Morphing body dynamics** with ellipsoid-to-sphere transitions
- **Realistic underwater physics** with momentum and drag
- **Enhanced propulsion moment physics** for realistic turning behavior

## Research Background

Based on research from the University of Pennsylvania Sung Robotics Lab:
- **Swimming Speed**: ~6.7 cm/s (0.2 body lengths/s)
- **Multi-Robot Benefits**: 9% velocity increase, 16% acceleration boost when coordinated
- **Energy Efficiency**: Cost of transport ~2.0
- **Bidirectional**: Forward and reverse propulsion possible

See `SALP_RESEARCH.md` for detailed research references and implementation notes.

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Run SALP Robot Demo
```bash
python salp_robot.py
```

**Controls:**
- **HOLD SPACE**: Inhale water (slow contraction)
- **RELEASE SPACE**: Exhale water (slow expansion + thrust)
- **‚Üê/‚Üí Arrow Keys**: Steer rear nozzle left/right
- **ESC**: Quit

## Gymnasium Environment

The SALP robot is implemented as a Gymnasium environment and can be used for reinforcement learning research:

```python
import gymnasium as gym
from salp_robot import SalpRobotEnv

# Create environment
env = SalpRobotEnv(render_mode="human")
observation, info = env.reset()

# Run simulation
for _ in range(1000):
    action = env.action_space.sample()  # Random action
    observation, reward, done, truncated, info = env.step(action)
    env.render()
    
    if done or truncated:
        observation, info = env.reset()

env.close()
```

## Action and Observation Spaces

### SALP Robot
- **Action Space**: `[inhale_control (0/1), nozzle_direction (-1 to 1)]`
- **Observation Space**: `[pos_x, pos_y, vel_x, vel_y, body_angle, angular_vel, body_size, breathing_phase, water_volume, nozzle_angle]`

## Key Implementation Features

### Breathing Cycle Mechanics
1. **Rest Phase**: Ellipsoid shape (natural resting state)
2. **Inhaling Phase**: Transition from ellipsoid to sphere (filling with water)
3. **Exhaling Phase**: Sphere back to ellipsoid (expelling water + thrust)

### Physics Simulation
- **Constant Surface Area**: Maintains realistic body volume during morphing
- **Underwater Drag**: Realistic water resistance and momentum
- **Thrust Vectoring**: Angled nozzle creates both forward thrust and turning moments
- **Wall Bouncing**: Realistic collision with tank boundaries

## Research Applications

This simulation is designed for:
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Training agents to learn optimal swimming patterns
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Studying salp chain formations
- **Bio-Inspired Robotics**: Understanding underwater propulsion mechanisms
- **Control Systems**: Developing efficient underwater vehicle control strategies
